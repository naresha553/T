Initial approach steps for AL2 to Al2023
Scenarios:
 * If app team is ok to use different hostname for al2023, then we have straight forward procedure to launch a new instance, setup and handover.
 * If app team is ok to use different hostname for al2023 but if there is dependency with old hostname
   a. then we follow procedure to launch a new instance, and setup DNS alias in route53 (with old hostname) and handover.
 * If app team have a strict dependency on old hostname to be used for new al2023 hostname, then we are currently checking on the procedure with below
   a. Preparation: We are planning to prepare the terraform module for migration to do the following steps, since the old ec2 instance should be down throughout the migration process.
 * Script will Collect the fstab entries Bring down the old AL2 server.
 * Change dns hostname ec2 instance tag to "<hostname>-old" for AL2 ec2 instance
 * Script will wait for the the next execution till "<hostname>-old" reflects in route53(lambda job trigger will do the update)
 * create snapshots and volumes of the ebs volume of old AL2 box
 * create a new ec2 instance with original hostname and attach the volumes created by step 4
 * mirror the ec2 instance tags like as old EC2 box
 * assign the security groups like old AL2 server
 * automation process will run the application ansible playbook to configure app related unix level setup
 * handoff to app team to migrate application.

b. Backout: in case of backout we can powerdown the new al2023 box and change the dns hostname tag entry as below
 * change AL2023 dns hostname tag as hostname-mig2023 and shutdown.
 * wait for the the next execution till "<hostname>-old" reflects in route53(lambda job trigger will do the update)
 * change AL2 dns hostname tag from hostname-old to original hostname and bringup



Need to know related to  AWSâ€™s recommended best practices for migrating from AL2 to AL2023,  and the current plan we have mentioned, need guidance if this approach for is fine to move on?

do we have any AWS tools that can help automate or simplify this type of migration?

Are there any limitations when re-attaching AL2 EBS volumes to AL2023 instances?

Any recommendations for handling security group assignments during migration?

Would need to know if any customers approached with any common issues related to al2-al2023 migration?

Any recommended approach for minimizing downtime during hostname cutover?

AWS plan for future Amazon Linux os versions releases, can we have inplace upgrade in future?
