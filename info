Here’s a streamlined approach for setting up your VM provisioning workflow with Nutanix, ServiceNow (SNOW), Terraform Enterprise (TFE), and Bitbucket:

1. Define the Workflow in SNOW
SNOW Form Setup: Configure SNOW to capture all necessary details for VM provisioning, including VM specs, environment, user details, and approval process.
Automate Approvals: Use SNOW workflows to automatically trigger the next steps after approvals, reducing manual steps.
Integration with TFE: Set up the SNOW form to send requests directly to Terraform Enterprise. This can be achieved by defining an API connection that calls a specific TFE workspace once the form is submitted and approved.
2. TFE Workspace Configuration
Provisioning Code in Bitbucket: Maintain the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files, including Nutanix VM configurations, in a Bitbucket repository. Each environment and configuration can have its own branch/version.
Version Control: Ensure that only approved versions of the code are available for TFE to use, which improves governance and traceability.
API-Driven Execution: Use TFE’s API to trigger the appropriate workspace with the Bitbucket code version when a request is received from SNOW, enabling a fully automated provisioning process.
3. Nutanix Management
Nutanix Provider in TFE: Configure the Nutanix provider in Terraform to allow TFE to manage Nutanix as a hypervisor, facilitating VM creation and configuration.
Resource Modules: Define reusable Terraform modules for Nutanix that include templates for VM specs, networking, storage, and security. This will simplify management and allow for easier updates.
4. Bitbucket Integration
Version-Specific Code Invocation: Set up Bitbucket to work with TFE by linking specific branches or tags to different TFE workspaces.
Triggering Mechanism: When a SNOW request is approved, it triggers TFE to pull a specific version or branch from Bitbucket to ensure that only validated code is used for provisioning.
Webhooks for Automation: Utilize Bitbucket webhooks to trigger re-runs or updates in TFE when there are code changes, ensuring TFE is always aligned with the latest code versions.
5. Monitoring and Compliance
Logging and Monitoring: Use TFE’s logs and Nutanix’s built-in monitoring to keep track of each VM provisioning request. This helps with auditing and compliance.
Notifications: Set up notifications in SNOW and TFE for key provisioning events to ensure stakeholders are updated.
Cost Control and Quotas: Use Nutanix’s and TFE’s policies to enforce resource quotas and prevent overprovisioning, which is essential for cost management.
By following these steps, you’ll have an efficient, fully integrated process from SNOW request submission through to automated VM provisioning in Nutanix, governed by TFE and tracked with version control in Bitbucket. This setup also allows for flexibility and easy scaling as demands grow.
